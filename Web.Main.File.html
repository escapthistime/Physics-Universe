	</centerpark> we need to wait the website resubsite thie time and upload the totally number of the electrons. patons, nuetrons datas, after that we give the 
	inital number of the experiment and the data calculation, after that then the calculations can back of the most significant probability of the quantum wind. 
	Tht quantum sunmption of the wild is the sunmmary of the wild numbers. After that, let's expplain the such number of the quantum discord, whcih is the special
	sitiuation of the quantum entanglement. The quantum entanglement gives the a way to describe the connection of many body quantums in the phase sapce, which
	which is the higher dimensional of the connnection between two particles. And discord is much higher dimentional than the quantum discord. And nower we main aim 
	is to clear the noise of the system and give the exact experiment of the system.

		<b> In some assistant, the experiment web and consistants are closed these days, which can not give the exactally number of the experiments.
		 After all we have to calculate the such number by using difusion model and sumulate the quite number of the users.</b>

			<a href='' target="_red"> the total right data of the difussion number is \partial{\expsilon^2}{m^2} = \frac{\lambda * \partial_h ^ 4 G^2 
				{(k-\frac{G}{2})}^2}{4U}
